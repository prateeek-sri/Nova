        *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
    *   Copy the contents from `.env.example` (if available) and fill in the required values. If `.env.example` is not available, manually create the necessary variables as described below:


        CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[> Your Clerk secret key <]
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[> Your Clerk publishable key <]
        ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=[> Your Astra DB application token <]
        ASTRA_DB_ENDPOINT=[> Your Astra DB endpoint <]
        MONGODB_URI=[> Your MongoDB connection URI <]
        UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=[> Your Upstash Redis REST URL <]
        UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=[> Your Upstash Redis REST token <]
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=[> Your Google API key <]
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
                > **Note:** Ensure you have the correct credentials for Clerk, Astra DB, MongoDB, Upstash, and Google GenAI. Refer to their respective documentation for setup instructions.

### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:

    bash

## Deployment

### Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Other Platforms

You can also deploy to other platforms like Netlify, AWS, or a custom server. Refer to the Next.js documentation for detailed instructions.

> Include specific deployment steps or configurations required for your project. For example, setting up environment variables on the deployment platform.  Specifically, describe how to set environment variables in Vercel, Netlify, etc.

## Troubleshooting

> Add common issues and their solutions here. For example:

-   **Issue**: "Module not found" error.
    **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
-   **Issue**: Database connection error.
    **Solution**: Verify your database URL and credentials in the `.env.local` file. Ensure the database server is running.
-   **Issue**: Clerk authentication issues.
    **Solution**: Check your Clerk API keys and ensure they are correctly configured in the `.env.local` file and your Clerk dashboard.  Verify your Clerk application is properly set up with the correct URLs.
-   **Issue**: Google GenAI API errors.
    **Solution**: Verify your Google API key and ensure it has the necessary permissions for the GenAI service.
